	<p>Keep looking. <br>Not now, <br>but keep looking</p>
	<p>5/26</p>
	<p>When someone insists that they're right even when they're not <br>When someone forgets everything, and as a result, fucks you up too <br>When someone takes the credit of something you did and benefits off this credit <br>When someone insists you did something wrong when you weren't even there in the first place <br>Stupidity. Corruption. Hypocrisy. <br>At this point, just go to hell.</p>
	<p>5/27</p>
	<p>Villains aren't born. They're made. <br>It's not how much you have, but how much you lost.</p>
	<p>5/28</p>
	<p>When the suspect plays victim, <br>And the victim gets persecuted___</p>
	<p>5/29</p>
	<p>CORRUPTION. SETUPS. PHONIES.</p>
	<p>5/30</p>
	<p>When you're about to start, and it all falls apart right in front of you...</p>
	<p>5/31</p>
	<p>Manipulation. The power exists out there. I've seen it.</p>
	<p>6/1</p>
	<p>Why can't I have it too?</p>
	<p>6/2</p>
	<p>You wake up, but something seems... different, unfamiliar.</p>
	<p>6/3</p>
	<p>But things that should be different feel oddly similar.</p>
	<p>6/4</p>
	<p>Always one step off, always at the wrong time… <br>…what is time anyways? How do we perceive it?</p>
	<p>6/5</p>
	<p>Do you believe that for every decision that could've been made out there, lies a branch in the timeline to a new reality? <br>And if we backtrack along that timeline, we can relive our lives and this time, make the right choices?</p>
